    <h1>About MapleNow</h1>
    <p>I decided to make this website because I was having trouble finding lists of salon and plastic surgery listings that weren't years old or presented in a way that was easy to look through. In the future I hope to devote more time to this website so that it is a page that holds much more information.</p>
    <h2>About the Developer</h2>
    <p>I'm a web developer that plays on the GMS Reboot and Broa servers. I have been playing GMS Maplestory (on and off) since 2006! If you see me around feel free to say hey!</p>
    <p>This website is running simply out of interest for the community, so consider donating through Paypal <a href="http://paypal.me/darlenez" target="_blank">here</a> to keep this page running.</p>
